# MagicalPencil

Magical Pencil is a video game telling a story about a journey of a deserter who has a magical pencil by which whatever is drawn becomes real. In the game, players can create whatever they want by hand drawing to help the character gets to his home. The game can recognize what the player is drawing, and spawn a corresponding item in the game world, with an appearance of the playerâ€™s doodle, to interact with the player.
